# Managing a device

The Device panel lets you view:

- The general settings of a LoRaWANÂ® or a cellular device

- And if opened in edit mode, edit some information of the device such
  as its name, model, location\...

It also gives you at a glance:

- The device's activity summary and location

- Traffic history and radio statistics charts that you can print or
  download.

If no device has been yet created by you or other end-users of your
subscriber account, you cannot display this panel.

If you have read-only access to Device Manager, the information
displayed is read-only. Read more\... For more information, see [Opening
a panel and checking your read-/write
access](../use-interface.md#opening-a-panel-and-checking-your-read-write-access).
