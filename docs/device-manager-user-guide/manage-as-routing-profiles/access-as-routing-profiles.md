# Accessing AS routing profiles

The AS Routing Profiles panel displays LoRaWAN® and cellular AS routing
profiles that can be created, edited and deleted by the read-write
access end-users of Device Manager. Read-only access end-users only can
open AS routing profiles in view mode to check their parameters.

The panel also displays the default AS routing profiles. For more
information, see [Changing the default AS routing
profile](change-default-as-routing-profile)
