more information, see [Opening a panel and checking your read-write
access](../use-interface.md#opening-a-panel-and-checking-your-read-write-access).

routing profiles.

In the AS routing profiles panel, the first AS routing profile you have
created appears with a **True** status in the Is
default column of the AS routing profiles frame. According to the
connectivity selected, this AS routing profile is used by default by the
New device dialog box when creating a device.

you will then have one default LoRaWAN® AS routing profile and one
default cellular AS routing profile.
