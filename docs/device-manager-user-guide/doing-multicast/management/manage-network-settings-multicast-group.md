In the Network panel of a multicast group, you can get information about
the current network subscription of the multicast group that is a
LoRaWAN® multicast connectivity plan:

- If the multicast connectivity plan is already associated, you can also
  **View** it.

- If you have read-write access Read more\... For more information, see
  [Opening a panel and checking your read-write
  access](../../use-interface.md#opening-a-panel-and-checking-your-read-write-access),
  you can also **Change** or **Remove** it, or **Allocate** it if no
  connectivity plan is associated.

For more information, see [LoRaWAN® multicast connectivity plan
details](../../reference-information.md#lorawan®-multicast-connectivity-plan-details).
