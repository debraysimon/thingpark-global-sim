# Authenticating using an initial password

If the account details email you received has no URL to click, you must
log in using an initial password that is a single-use password, then
change this password.

The initial password is not written in the account details email. Your
vendor provides you with it by another mean.

Â 

1.  If your vendor did not provide you with your initial password,
    contact him/her.

2.  In your Internet browser, launch the following URL with the domain
    name of your operator: `https://operatordomain/devicemanager`.

3.  In the Sign in window that opens, click **Sign in with ThingPark**.

    were provided with, then click **Log In**.

        -\>A visual indicator lets you know the strength level of the
        password.

    2.  In the **Confirm password** box: Type the same password.

- If some instructions appear, apply them repeating step 5 and 6. The
  password satisfies your operator security policy when the instructions
  stop. If necessary, contact your vendor.
