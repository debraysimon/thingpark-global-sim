# Overview

The scope of this document is to present Spectrum Analysis. This tool is
used to display noise-scan results generated by the base station, and to
determine the noise level seen by each frequency within the defined
spectrum.

Noise-Scan statistics are used to derive the average interference level
(that is rise above thermal noise floor) to be used for the link budget
analysis. It is also mandatory for the appropriate selection of physical
frequencies related to LoRaWANÂ® logical channels.
