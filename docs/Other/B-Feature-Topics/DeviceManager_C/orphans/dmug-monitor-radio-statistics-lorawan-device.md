# Monitoring radio statistics of a LoRaWAN® device

You can display charts representing the following radio statistics to
help you monitor or troubleshoot a LoRaWAN® device:

- **Packet Error Rate (PER)** with **Instant PER** and **Mean PER**

- **Estimated Signal Power (ESP)**

- **Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)**

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**

- **Spreading Factor (SF)**

This information is read-only. For more information about how devices
radio statistics is defined and computed in Device Manager, see [More about LoRaWAN® radio statistics](./dmug-more-lorawan-radio-statistics.md).

On the charts, you can display the following details for each device:

- **Daily average** or **Scatter packets** (**Distribution** or
  **Scatter packets** for SF)

- Over the **Last 7 days** or the **Last 15 days**

- For **All LRRs**, or a specific LRR, in the range of the device (Does
  not applies to SF).

**Tips**

- Hovering your mouse over an item of the chart displays additional
  traffic information.

- Clicking an item of the caption makes it disappear/appear in the chart
  and adjusts the scale.

 

1.  In the navigation panel, click **Devices** to display the Devices
    panel, then click the List or the **Map** tab.

2.  Select the device you want to check the activity. Click **View** or
    **Edit** to enter the Device panel.

3.  Scroll down the Device panel to display the **PER**, **ESP**,
    **RSSI**, **SNR** and **SF** tabs with the charts.

4.  Click the **PER** tab, then:

    - Click **Daily** average and
      **Last 7 days,** or **Last 15 days**, to view:

      - The daily average PER of the device over the selected period for
        all LRRs.

      - If available, select a specific LRR in the **All LRRs** list to
        display the Instant PER per LRR that is computed considering
        only the uplink frames received by a specific LRR.

    - Click **Scatter packets** and **Last 7 days,** or **Last 15
      days**, to view:

      - The device PER per packet over the selected period for all LRRs.
        If available, you can select a specific LRR in the **All LRRs**
        list.

5.  Click the **ESP** tab, then:

    - Click **Daily average** and **Last 7 days,** or **Last 15 days**,
      to view:

      - The daily average ESP of the device over the selected period for
        All LRRs. If available, you can select a specific LRR in the
        **All LRRs** list.

        ![](../_images/checking-the-activity-of-a-5.png)

    - Click **Scatter packets** and **Last 7 days,** or **Last 15
      days**, to view:

      - The device ESP per packet over the selected period for all LRRs.
        If available, you can select a specific LRR in the **All LRRs**
        list.

6.  Click the **RSSI** tab, then:

    - Click **Daily average** and **Last 7 days,** or **Last 15 days**,
      to view:

      - The daily average RSSI of the device over the selected period
        for All LRRs. If available, you can select a specific LRR in the
        **All LRRs** list.

        ![](../_images/checking-the-activity-of-a-7.png)

    - Click **Scatter packets** and **Last 7 days**, or **Last 15
      days**, to view:

      - The device RSSI per packet over the selected period for all
        LRRs. If available, you can select a specific LRR in the **All
        LRRs** list.

7.  Click the **SNR** tab, then:

    - Click **Daily average** and **Last 7 days,** or **Last 15 days**,
      to view:

      - The daily average SNR of the device over the selected period for
        All LRRs. If available, you can select a specific LRR in the
        **All LRRs** list.

        ![](../_images/checking-the-activity-of-a-9.png)

    - Click **Scatter packets** and **Last 7 days,** or **Last 15
      days**, to view:

      - The device SNR per packet over the selected period for all LRRs.
        If available, you can select a specific LRR in the **All LRRs**
        list.

8.  Click the **SF** tab, then:

    - Click **Distribution** and **Last 7 days,** or **Last 15 days**,
      to view:

      - The distribution of the spreading factors over the selected
        period.
