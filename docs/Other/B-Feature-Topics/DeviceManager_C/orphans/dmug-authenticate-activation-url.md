# Authenticating using an activation URL

If the account details email you received asks you to click **Account
Activation**, you have a time limit defined by your operator to create a
password using this URL.

By default, this time limit is fifteen minutes after the email is sent.
For more information, contact your vendor.

Â 

1.  In the email, click the **Account Activation**.

    proceed**.
