device](create-devices/create-lorawan-device.md#creating-an-abp-device),
and [Changing the device model](manage-a-device/change-device-model.md)
.

You must have read-write access. Read more\... For more information, see

## Setting alarm notification emails

## About alarm notification emails

In addition to the alarms notifications appearing in the Devices panel
and the Active alarms panel of a device Read more\... For more
information, see [Viewing not acknowledged alarms of your
network](manage-device-alarms/monitor-device-alarms.md#viewing-not-acknowledged-alarms-of-your-network)
and [More about searching
alarms](manage-device-alarms/monitor-device-alarms.md#more-about-searching-alarms),
you can set alarm notifications by email to monitor all devices of the
account when necessary, and independently of the device the alarm
belongs to:

- The **basic mode** lets you send notification emails whatever the
  alarm state to all recipients.

- The **advanced mode** lets you send notification emails to the
  recipients according to the alarm state.

An alarm state corresponds to a severity level of the alarm, or a
cleared or acknowledged alarm.

**Important**

- Click **Save** after you have finished your configuration in any mode.

- When shifting from the advanced mode to the basic mode and clicking
  **Save**, the basic mode overwrites what you have set in the advanced
  mode.

- The Setting panel opens with the last saved configuration mode.

You must have read-write access to Device Manager to set alarms
notifications emails. Read more\... For more information, see [Opening a
panel and checking your read-/write
access](use-interface.md#opening-a-panel-and-checking-your-read-write-access).

If you have read-only access, you can see who receives alarm
notification emails for which alarms state. For more information, see
[Viewing/Setting an alarm notification email in advanced
mode](#viewing-setting-an-alarm-notification-email-in-advanced-mode). If
you want to receive alarm notification emails, ask an end-user with
read-write access to set it for you.

## Setting alarm notification emails in basic mode

In basic mode, the recipient receives an email whenever an alarm is
triggered, whatever the alarm state (Critical, Major, Minor, Warning,
Indeterminate, Cleared or Acked).

You must have read-write access to Device Manager to set alarms
notifications emails. Read more\... For more information, see [Opening a
panel and checking your read-/write
access](use-interface.md#opening-a-panel-and-checking-your-read-write-access).

 

1.  Click **Settings** in the navigation panel to open the Settings
    panel.

    ![](./_images/setting-alarm-notification-1.png)

3.  Click the row that appears, and in the **Name** box, enter the name
    of the recipient you want to add.

4.  In the **Destination** box, enter the recipient email address.

5.  If you want to add more recipients, repeat from step 1.

6.  Click **Save**.

    -\> The recipients registered will receive an email whenever an
    alarm is triggered on any device.

## Viewing/Setting an alarm notification email in advanced mode

In advanced mode, if an alarm state having a registered recipient is
reached, an email for all devices impacted is sent:

- Whenever a new alarm is triggered with this alarm state.

- Whenever an existing alarm changes to this alarm state.  
  **Note** For an event-driven alarm, no email is sent for any new
  occurrence if the alarm state is the same. For more information, see
  [Alarm occurrence
  management](manage-device-alarms/index.md#alarm-occurrence-management).

- Whenever the alarm has been acknowledged and increases to this alarm
  state.  
  **Note** When an acknowledged alarm increases its alarm state, the
  acknowledgement is canceled by the system.

Alarm states are related to severity levels and associated with the
following color codes:

| Alarm state                | Definition                                                                                           |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Critical** (Red)         | The service is affected, and an immediate corrective action is required.                             |
| **Major** (Orange)         | The service is partly affected, and an urgent action is required.                                    |
| **Minor** (Yellow)         | A fault that does not affect the service should be corrected to prevent a more serious problem.      |
| **Warning** (Blue)         | A potential or impending fault affecting the service should be diagnosed and corrected if necessary. |
| **Indeterminate** (Purple) | The severity cannot be determined.                                                                   |
| **Cleared** (Green)        | The alarm has satisfied the clearing conditions and has been cleared by the system.                  |
