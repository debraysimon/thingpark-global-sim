# Monitoring alarms

To monitor your fleet of devices, you can:

- View all not acknowledged alarms of your fleet of devices

- View all alarms of a device you want to check

- Filter active, cleared and acknowledged alarms

- Get the information returned by an active and a cleared alarm

- Check if a cleared alarm has already been triggered during the last
  fifteen days

- Get the last status with the associated information before clearance

- Check that an alarm you have troubleshot is cleared

- Detect a situation where the device is instable.

The following tasks give an example of scenario to deal with the alarms
of your devices.

By default, the display of alarms is set to show not acknowledged
alarms, except in the Alarm history panel of the device.

## Viewing not acknowledged alarms of your network

You can have a global view of all the not acknowledged alarms of your
fleet of devices in the Devices panel. The alarms can be active or
cleared. It allows you to detect devices to investigate.

If you prefer being notified when alarms are triggered and change states
on your device fleet, see [Setting alarm notification
emails](../device-manager-settings.md#setting-alarm-notification-emails).

 

1.  In the navigation panel, click **Devices**.

2.  In the Devices panel, click the **List** tab.

    -\> In the Alarm column, a color displays the number of alarms that
    have not been acknowledged, whether active or cleared, with the
    highest state of them. Green is for cleared alarm, that is
    considered as a final state. For more information about alarm
    states, see [Alarm states](index.md#alarm-states).

      to see it anymore in the default display, click it, and click
      **Ack**. For more information, see [Acknowledging
      alarms](acknowledge-alarms.md).

## Investigating a cleared alarm in the alarms history of the device

If you want to know more about a cleared alarm, you can investigate its
last status before clearance in the Alarm history panel of the device.
It gives you the last level of severity the alarm had before clearance
with the information that triggered it. For more information about alarm
states, see [Alarm states](index.md#alarm-states).

The Alarm history panel displays the last status before clearance of
alarms that have been cleared during the past 15 days regarding the
device. By default, this panel is set with no filter.

**Notes**
