# Managing the alarms of a multicast group

You can manage the alarms of a multicast group from its Active alarms
and Alarms history panels.

The following alarm applies to multicast groups:

- **Alarm 002: Traffic Exceeds the Downlink Regulator Settings**.

Â 

1.  In the navigation panel, click **Multicast groups**.

2.  In the list displayed in the Search frame of the Multicast Groups
    panel, select the multicast group you want to open, and click
    **View** or **Edit** if you have read-write access.

    -\> The multicast group appears in the navigation panel.

3.  In the multicast group displayed in the navigation panel, click
    **Alarms**.

    -\> The Active alarms panel opens showing the current status of
    active and cleared alarms of the multicast group.

4.  In the navigation panel, click **History**.

    -\> The Alarms history panel opens showing the last status before
    clearance of all the alarms that have been cleared during the past
    15 days.

    For more information, see [Managing
    alarms](../../manage-device-alarms/index.md) that works similarly.
