# Doing multicast

Multicast is only applicable to LoRaWAN速 connectivity.

You must have read-write access to Device Manager to create a multicast
network of devices. If you have read-only access, this topic shows you
how to view your multicast network and get information about it. Read
more\... For more information, see [Opening a panel and checking your
read-/write
access](../use-interface.md#opening-a-panel-and-checking-your-read-write-access).

## About multicast

Unicast OTAA or ABP devices supporting multicast can receive
simultaneously the same downlink payload in a LoRaWAN速 network if they:

- Share the same LoRaWAN速 version, identifiers, keys, and class as the
  multicast group they will work with, whether they have been already
  created or not with their own LoRaWAN速 version, identifiers and keys
  as unicast devices. For more information, see [Creating a multicast
  group](create-multicast-group-associated-base-stations-group.md#creating-a-multicast-group).

- Are in the coverage of one or more base stations having their tag
  added to this multicast group. For more information, see [Adding a
  base station tag to a multicast
  group](create-multicast-group-associated-base-stations-group.md#adding-a-base-station-tag-to-a-multicast-group).

The multicast downlink is an unconfirmed data down message without MAC
commands. For more information, see [LRC-AS Tunnel Interface Developer
Guide](../../integrating-applications-with-tpw.md#lrc-as-tunnel-interface-developer-guide).
