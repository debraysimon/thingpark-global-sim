You must have read-write access to Device Manager to create devices. If
you have read-only access, this topic gives you background information
about the devices you can view and the parameters they use. Read

read-write
access](../use-interface.md#opening-a-panel-and-checking-your-read-write-access).

## About creating devices

Creating devices in Device Manager lets you register the devices you
have in order to connect them to your IoT network.

Using a LoRaWAN® or a cellular model created by your operator,
you can create respectively LoRaWAN® or cellular devices, either one by
one or by mass importation.

To work properly, a LoRaWAN® or a cellular device also needs to be
associated with:

- A connectivity plan you have subscribed

- An AS routing profile containing one or more destinations, that can be
  different types of application servers.

**Tip** In Device Manager, you can create devices before or after
creating a destination and an AS routing profile. If you want to create
and provision a device in one step less, create first the destination
and the AS routing profile by following the guidelines given in
[Managing local application
servers](../manage-local-application-servers/index.md) and [Managing AS
routing profiles](../Manage%20as%20routing%20profiles/index.md). Then, go back
to [Creating devices](/B-Feature-Topics/DeviceManager_C/create-devices/Overview.md).
