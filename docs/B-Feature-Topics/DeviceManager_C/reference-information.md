## Building your CSV file to import devices
This section helps you construct your CSV file when you want to add or delete devices
in bulk. For more information, see [Importing LoRaWAN® or cellular
devices](create-devices/import-lorawan-cellular-devices.md).

### Import CSV file for cellular devices

The following table describes the contents of the formatted CSV file you
must create to import or delete cellular devices.

Use [TP-Wireless-7.2-device-import-MTC-rev1.xlsx](https://actilitysa.sharepoint.com/:f:/t/product/EkYYeyb6bPZEqYK-hnBu3uABXSt29dwu2brjRVzGKQKMTA?e=dfHRiL)
as a sample to guide you through the process.

The following table describes the contents of the formatted CSV file you
must create to import or delete LoRaWAN® devices in ABP mode.

Use [TP-Wireless-7.2-device-import-ABP-rev1.xlsx](https://actilitysa.sharepoint.com/:f:/t/product/EkYYeyb6bPZEqYK-hnBu3uABXSt29dwu2brjRVzGKQKMTA?e=dfHRiL)
as a sample to guide you through the process.

## Connectivity plans

This section provides quick access to the details of all connectivity
plans. For more information about connectivity plans, see [Viewing
connectivity plans](view-connectivity-plans.md) and [Managing the
connectivity plan of a
device](manage-device-network/manage-connectivity-plan-device.md).


### Cellular IoT connectivity plan details

The Connectivity plan details frame, which gives information about the
connectivity plan, is displayed in the Connectivity plans panel. This
frame is for information only.

It displays the name, ID and description of the connectivity plan, and
provides a view on its main characteristics. The default values, that

### LoRaWAN® unicast connectivity plan details

The Connectivity plan details frame, which gives information about the
connectivity plan, is displayed in the Connectivity plans panel. This
frame is for information only.

It gives the name, ID and description of the connectivity plan, and
provides a view on its main characteristics. The default values, that
are not displayed in Device Manager, are given here as a guide for
troubleshooting purpose.

| **Uplink Regulator policy**                                 | Describes how the network behaves in case of uplink traffic overload. **Mark**: The system will keep track of the device packets exceeding the limits set. Exceeding packets are sent and marked as overflow packets. Additional fees may be applied by the operator. **Drop**: The system will drop the device packets exceeding the limits set. Exceeding packets are deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Mark                                         |

| **Asynchronous UL processing**                              | Enabled if higher than zero milliseconds, it makes the LRC wait for an application server downlink payload before sending the LoRaWan® downlink to the device on RX1/RX2 response windows. The value defines the maximum delay the LRC can wait forward the AS payload in the downlink answer to the device, and thus the maximum delay the application server can send the AS downlink payload. If the delay is expired, the AS downlink payload will wait the next device uplink to be forwarded in the next downlink answer to the device. By default, this parameter is set to zero milliseconds which means that the synchronous uplink processing is enabled, and the LRC does not wait for the application server downlink payload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 0                                            |

| **Downlink regulator policy**                               | Describes how the network behaves in case of downlink traffic overload. **Mark**: The system will keep track of the device packets exceeding the limits set. Exceeding packets are sent and marked as overflow packets. Additional fees may be applied by the operator. **Drop**: The system will drop the device packets exceeding the limits set. Exceeding packets are deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Mark                                         |
