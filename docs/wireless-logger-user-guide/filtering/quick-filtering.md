# Quick filtering

In the Last packets list, you can refine
your search by reusing values to fill in automatically the corresponding
filters in the search bar.
Quick filters associated with filters
of the search bar are the following. They share the name of the column
they are located.

1.  In the Last packets list, click filter icon next to the value you want to
    enter in the corresponding filter of the search bar. **Example**
    Clicking the **DevEUI** quick filter allows you to filter only
    packets from a specific device.

2.  (Optional) If you want to enter more values in the same filter, type
    a comma from the keyboard, then type manually the next value.

3.  Click **Refresh** to relaunch the search and reload the packets.
