## Radio color codes

Wireless Logger displays a range of colors for radio parameters that are
subject to limited values in the columns of the Last packets list. For more
information about LoRaWAN® radio parameters, see [LoRaWAN® radio
statistics](#lorawan-radio-statistics).

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Estimated Signal Power

In the SNR and ESP
columns, Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Estimated Signal Power
parameters apply the following rules:

| Parameter                        | Green               | Orange                          | Red                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**  | `value ≥ - 8 dB`    | `- 13 dB ≤ value ≤ - 8 dB`      | `value < - 13 dB`   |
| **Estimated Signal Power (ESP)** | `value ≥ - 100 dBm` | `- 110 dBm ≤ value ≤ - 100 dBm` | `value < - 110 dBm` |

### Spreading Factor or Data Rate

In the **SF/DR** column, if a Spreading Factor or a Data Rate displays a
value, the following rules apply:

| Spreading Factor or Data Rate value | Displayed color |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Value ≤ SF10                        | Green           |
| Value is SF11                       | Orange          |
| Value is SF12                       | Red             |
| Value is FDRx                       | Cyan            |

### RX2

If the value displayed in the **Channel** column is RX2, it is displayed
in orange.

## LoRaWAN® radio statistics

This topic provides information about the calculation of LoRaWAN® radio
parameters. They apply to uplinks.

### Estimated Signal Power (ESP)

Estimates the real received signal strength of a desired signal
considering the impact of background noise.

Being the received signal strength of the useful signal, it
represents the S component in the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) formula.
Therefore, ESP can be computed as follows:
- ESP = Tx EIRP – Path Loss + Rx antenna gain
- ESP = RSSI – 10*LOG( 1 + 10(-SNR/10) )

Allows assessing how good the received signal is compared to the
minimum sensitivity level of the receiver. It is expressed in dBm and
always has negative values.

### Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)

Determines the total received signal strength within a channel
bandwidth summing up the useful signal (S), the interference (I), and
the background noise (N).

Expressed in dBm, RSSI is the sum S + I + N.

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)

Determines the quality of the reception through the ratio between
the received signal strength of the useful signal (S), and the signal
strength of the interference (I) added to the one of the background
noise (N).

It is computed like this: SNR = S/(I+N). It is expressed in
dB.

The higher the SNR (for instance positive SNR as opposed to
negative SNR), the better the reception quality.
