# LoRaWAN® export file

The following table gives the packets information available in the
LoRaWAN® export file. Most of the fields described are also accessible
via ThingPark Tunnel Interface. For more information, see [LRC-AS Tunnel
Interface Developer
Guide](https://oss-api.thingpark.com/tpw/7.1/Core-Network/lrc-as-tunnel-lorawan/).

From the export file, you can do several analysis such as:

- Percentage of lost packets

- Percentage LC traffic

- Percentage SF per LRR base station

For more information, see [Exporting](../export).
