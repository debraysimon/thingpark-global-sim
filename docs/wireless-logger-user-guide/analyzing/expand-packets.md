# Expanding packets

Expanding packets allows you to display all the packet metadata
including the payload.

Packet metadata is a series of information related to the transmission
or reception of the packet.

- The most important metadata is displayed in the columns of the
  collapsed view of the packet.

- For packets, the expanded view allows you to get the MAC commands and
  the applicative payload if any. For more information, see [Packet and
  payload](packet-and-payload.md).

## Expanding a packet

You can expand a packet to display all its metadata. You can also
collapse it.

## Expanding all packets

You can switch between a collapsed and an expanded view of all the
packets of the Last packets list. It
