# Overview

The Network Survey tool helps the users to visualize device data
(radio metrics, payload information) on a map. It also computes
additional uplink (UL) metrics based on those reported by the LRR to the
LRC.

This tool is very useful to assess LoRa network coverage status through
walk/drive tests, and detect any coverage gaps if proper payload decoder
is used. Downlink (DL) radio measurements can also be available in the
tool if they are sent by the device in UL frame payload.
